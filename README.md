This is an elimination game similar to the children game M.A.S.H some may have played.

The theme is based on things the caterpillar from teh childrens book "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" ate. The game takes an input of how many people are playing as well as how a n value 
that reperesents how many times the code will go round. In the end the code will produce one item that is "the best" thing the caterpillar ate. 

I use linked list, nodes, and tkinter to accomplish this.
